BankSimulation
==============

A Data Structures project in which we simulate a day at the bank.
My partner and I went above and beyond the assignment by adding a GUI and music to our project. 
The project can be run through the GUIDriver.class or the AppletSawinGraphics.class.
The intent was to put the applet form on my personal website, 
but due to security issues with accessing files in sandbox mode, I was not successful.
Read through the assignment sheet (given as project website) to understand what was 
required of the simulation as well as to download test cases so you can try it out yourself.
